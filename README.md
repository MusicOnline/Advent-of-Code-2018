# Advent of Code 2018

It's just me recording my participation in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).
Feel free to use any code from this project.

Works with Python 3.6+ and the code is type hinted to make mypy happy.
The code should also be well structured and compliant with PEP 8.
However, you do not need mypy to run the code.

First commit of a solution is what I come up with.
It is pushed when I have completed both parts of the day's challenges.
Subsequent commit would be a revision after receiving tips and referring to others' solutions.

## Installation

Python 3.6+ required. No dependencies (as of now, hopefully never).

Then, clone this repository using:

```git clone https://github.com/MusicOnline/Advent-of-Code-2018.git```
